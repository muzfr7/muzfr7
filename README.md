### Hi there 👋

I'm Muzafar Ali Jatoi, a Senior Backend Software Engineer with over a decade of professional experience. I specialize in building secure and scalable applications using microservices architecture with Go, PHP, and Python. My primary language is Go, and I have extensive experience in breaking monoliths into microservices and migrating services to Go from other programming languages.

I'm genuinely curious about AI and actively explore and integrate these technologies in both personal and professional projects. I have built several AI Agents and MCP servers and continue to learn, experiment, and apply these technologies.

#### Tech stack 👨‍💻
Go, PHP, Python, n8n, LangChain, MCP, gRPC, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform

#### Find me elsewhere 🌏
